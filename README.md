it is not already guessed and has the correct length)
- You can see in your previous guesses, the letters that are correct, that are in the correct word but
in the wrong position, and the letters that are not in the word, you can also see this status in the 
keyboard on the screen.
- If you win or lose you will get a message, and you will not be able to guess anymore.
- You can ask for a hint, using the hint button of the bottom of the screen, this will reveal
a random letter of the word, and that letter will be fixed for the rest of the game, it is possible 
to ask for more than one hint.
